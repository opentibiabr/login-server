### Getting **Started**

TBD

### Issues

We use the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/opentibiabr/login-server/issues). Keep in mind that everyone who is watching the repository gets notified by e-mail when there is an activity, so be thoughtful and avoid writing comments that aren't meant for an issue (e.g. "+1"). If you'd like for an issue to be fixed faster, you should either fix it yourself and submit a pull request, or place a bounty on the issue.

### Pull requests

Before [creating a pull request](https://github.com/opentibiabr/login-server/pulls) please keep in mind:

* Do not send Pull Request changing the map, as we can't review the changes it's better to use our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3NxYnyV) to talk about or send the map changes to the responsible for updating it.
* Focus on fixing only one thing, mixing too much things on the same Pull Request make it harder to review, harder to test and if we need to revert the change it will remove other things together.
* Follow the project indentation, if your editor support you can use the [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to automatic configure the indentation.
* There are people that doesn't play the game on the official server, so explain your changes to help understand what are you changing and why.
* Avoid opening a Pull Request to just update one line of an xml file.
